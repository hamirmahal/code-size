A simple yet helpful practical extension for VS Code, github, your over health and mental well-being. 

It is particularly useful in analyzing new repos. Do "git clone" not.  
Just open a repo in github.dev (press `.` in any github repository) and add this extension.

Or connect to any virtual workspace with remote repositories. Chances are it will work just as well.
